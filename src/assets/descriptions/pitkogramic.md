You've stumbled on a strange cave in the middle of a forest. 
\
\
The cave has what looks like a mine entrence, perhaps it's not natural - but there's also a slightly open door
bolted to it. A strange slightly glowing platform with a red button on a pole is to the right - do you press it?

From here, you can go: 
[NORTH](/parlor)

You see a sign to the left.
